Add files here for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Any relevant chunks will be automatically retrieved and piped into context when relevant to the conversation.

**Supported file types**: `.md` and `.txt` files

**Note**: The system automatically excludes README files from RAG processing.

**Testing**: Sample penguin facts are included for testing purposes - feel free to remove or keep them based on your needs.
