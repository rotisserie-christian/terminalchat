### Memory 

Put stuff in here, and any relevant chunks will be automatically piped into context when relevant.

Currently limited to md and txt files

The system will also exclude this file and any others named readme 

There are some penguin facts included as well, I'm using that for testing but you can feel free to leave it if your AI workflow involves penguins
